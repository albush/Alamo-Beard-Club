<h2>About</h2>
<p>The Alamo Beard Club promotes facial hair, friendship, and the community of San Antonio.</p>

<p>The Alamo Beard Club was established in July 2012, bringing together a group of appreciators and cultivators of facial hair. The group began as a social club and soon grew to include competitions. Centred around the celebration of facial hair and a strong community charity focus. Alamo Beard Club&#8217;s competitions bring together the competitors and spectators to support San Antonio. </p>

<p>Currently, the Alamo Beard Club hosts an annual charity Beard and Moustache competition during San Antonio’s world famous Fiesta, volunteers to support local charities and businesses as well as sends competitors to local, regional and international competitions.</p>

<h2>Charitable Focus</h2>
<p>The Alamo Beard Club is founded as an altruistic organization, and has worked with many different local and national charities.</p>

<p>Our initial facial hair competition, in October 2012, raised $800 for the <a href="http://westsidedoginitiative.blogspot.com/p/about">Westside Dog Initiative</a>. The WDI is a community-based initiative developed to bring awareness to and to help remedy the rampant stray animal problem in San Antonio’s Westside community.</p>

<p>In November 2012, we raised $673 in conjunction with <a href="http://us.movember.com/">Movember</a>. Movember raises vital awareness and funds for men&#8217;s health issues, specifically prostate and testicular cancer initiatives.</p>

<p>In December 2012, Alamo Beard Club partnered with local business The Friendly Spot to collect toys and donations for USMC&#8217;s <a href="http://www.toysfortots.org/">Toys for Tots</a>. </p>

<p>In March 2013, we raised $400 as well as clothing and toy donations for the <a href="http://www.fvps.org/">Family Violence Prevention Services of San Antonio</a>. Who help to break the cycle of violence and to strengthen families, by providing the necessary tools for self-sufficiency</p>

<p>In April 2013, we raised over $1700 for <a href="http://www.casa-satx.org/">Child Advocates of San Antonio</a>. CASA recruits, trains, and supervises court-appointed volunteer Advocates who provide constancy for abused and neglected children and youth while advocating for services and placement in safe and permanent homes. The money raised during Beard Royal was enough to foster two children for one year.</p>

<p>In April 2014 we held our 3rd annual Beard and Mustache Competition - the Alamo City BeardCon. Competitors and spectators helped raise over $2200 for the <a href="http://www.woundedwarriorproject.org/">Wounded Warrior Project</a>. If you want to donate in our name, you can still do so at our <a href="https://support.woundedwarriorproject.org/group-fundraising/alamobeardclub/">Wounded Warriors Donation site</a>.</p>
